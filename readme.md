# Kaggle Airbnb New York

## Introduction

This is a data analysis of the [Airbnb New York dataset]((https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) provided by Kaggle.

Since the original dataset is quite small (7 MB), I have included it in this repo as `new_york_data.csv`. This dataset is accurate as of November 11, 2019.

I use matplotlib to visualize various parts of the data and scikit-learn to create a machine learning model to predict new data.

All code here is fully free to use and share.
