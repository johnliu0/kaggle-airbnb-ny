# Kaggle Airbnb New York

## Introduction

This is a data analysis of the [Airbnb New York dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) provided by Kaggle.

Since the original dataset is quite small (7 MB), I have included it in this repo as `new_york_data.csv`. This dataset is accurate as of November 11, 2019.

I use matplotlib to visualize and explore various parts of the data.

All code here is fully free to use and share! I'd appreciate the credit if you are to use anything here.
